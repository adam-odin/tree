(this is going to be hard going, possibly forever!)


Think from the perspective of "The Definition of ... is ..."

any number n means exactly that number n 
unknown/uncertain _n means approximately that number
_10^3 means approximately 1000 etc.


** TABLE part (id, it): (for example, part(it): proton)

* particles
electron (-1e, 1/2 spin)

proton
up-quark (+2/3e) (!0 discreet one of three colour charge)
down-quark (-1/3e) (!0 discreet one of three colour charge)

strange-quark (short life / only produced in high energy collisions) (-1/3e)
charm-quark (ditto) (+2/3e)
top-quark (ditto) (+2/3e)
bottom-quark (ditto) (-1/3e)

[each quark has anti-quark with opposite properties, combined they make meson, tetraquarks like a double meson and hybrid quarks q-q+1+g]
[neutron composed of 2 down-quark 1 up-quark] plus pentaquarks (three quarks plus q-q pair, hybrid baryons 3q + 1+g)

photon (0 mass, speed c, 0 charge)

gluon (_0 mass, !0 color-charge, spin 1) (_n > glueballs, rare, hybrids - mix q-qg +) carry color plus anticolor 
W+boson (>0 mass)
W-boson (>0 mass)
Z-boson (>0 mass)




* forces
gravitational (infinte range)
electromagnetic (infinite range)
strong-nuclear (short range (within atom?)) => colour confinement? quantum chromodynamics QCD. "Forms a narrow flux tube (or string) between color charges" Strong force between particles remains constant regardless of separation??? strong interaction energy is ~99% of mass (individual quarks only ~1%)
weak-nuclear (short range (within atom?))

collision (for example, high energy can be an "ingredient" 
of event but i think we have to binary distinguish contact or none)


* concepts

speed in a vacuum (measured in m/s)
[range from 0 to c (299,792,458)]

mass

energy (measured in joule J or electronvolt eV)
[range from ]

electromagnetic wavelength (measured in nm)
[range from plank's constant to _1,000,000]

electromagnetic frequency (inverse of wavelength)

electric-charge 
color-charge (red, green, blue and anti ... - should this be in gluon or attribute assigned to gluon??)

spin

temperature/heat (maybe no place for it here, 
being derivative of energy?)

half-life


* measurements 
(is this different from concepts? 
i think yes because it is only one self sufficient measurements
whereas concept combines at least two - speed is m/s, wavelength is energy)

length/distance

time

temperature
[range - to 2 terakelvin (Hagedorn) for gluons to ?]
(mapping temperature to energy 130-140MeV)
